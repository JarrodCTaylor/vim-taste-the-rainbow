# Taste The Rainbow

I don't tend to enjoy color schemes that look like a bag of brightly colored
candy has exploded all over my editor. However, sometimes having colored braces
can be of value. In those rare occasions this plug-in provides two convenience
functions `TasteTheRainbow` and `ChillTheRainbow`.
